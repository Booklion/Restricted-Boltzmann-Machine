# Restricted Boltzmann Machine
A Restricted Boltzmann Machine implementation for the second midterm for the Intelligent Systems for Pattern Recognition course, University of Pisa.

This model was trained on the MNIST dataset to encode the images. Two classifiers (Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine) were trained on the encoded dataset and tested to recognize the numbers.
